## Things learnt doing this exercise 

-addEventListener , how to create element in Javascript and append it to body
-learnt how to implement counter function to make things to happen for multiple clicks


## Problems faced

-on mouse over multiple images were getting added hence click function was not working on multiple image

##Fix for the problem

Used if loop to just add the image only once


## Exercise Instructions


    Create a simple html page with one button in the middle of the page
    Give this button the id "doge"
    Give this button the text Doggo

Now we're going to do some modifications to the doge button, do them step by step:

    When the page is finished loading, change the text to "Woof!"
    When you hover over the button "Woof!" should disappear and a little doggo icon should appear instead
    When you click the button a picture of a doge should show up somewhere on the page
    When you click the button again, the picture should disappear
